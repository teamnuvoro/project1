Modify the existing chat Edge Function (supabase/functions/chat/index.ts) to use cumulative summary context.

Current functionality: Receives message, calls Groq, saves response.

New functionality needed:

1. Before calling Groq:
   - Fetch user_cumulative_summary from database WHERE user_id = input.userId
   - Store in variable: userSummary

2. Create function: buildSystemPrompt(userSummary)
   - If userSummary is null, return default generic prompt
   - If userSummary exists, return detailed context prompt

   Detailed prompt should include:
   - Introduction: "You are Rajjo, an AI companion..."
   - Section: "ABOUT THIS USER:" followed by cumulative_summary
   - Section: "USER'S PERSONALITY:" with traits, communication style, emotional needs, values, interests
   - Section: "WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR:" with ideal_partner_type and relationship_expectations
   - Section: "CONVERSATION GUIDANCE:" with mood_pattern, primary_conversation_theme, engagement_level
   - Section: "TOPICS TO EXPLORE:" with what_to_explore items
   - Section: "SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS:" with suggested_conversation_starters
   - Section: "GROWTH AREAS:" with growth_areas items
   - Section: "INSTRUCTIONS:" with guidelines like:
     * Remember what you know about this user
     * Ask deeper questions
     * Be genuinely interested
     * Match their communication style
     * Reference past conversations
     * Help them explore new perspectives
     * Support growth areas

3. Call Groq with this structure:
   {
     model: "mixtral-8x7b-32768",
     system: buildSystemPrompt(userSummary),  // ← INCLUDES FULL CONTEXT
     messages: [conversation history + new message],
     temperature: 0.7,
     max_tokens: 1024
   }

4. After generating response:
   - Save messages to database (user + assistant)
   - Update session stats
   - Trigger generate-user-summary Edge Function asynchronously
     supabase.functions.invoke('generate-user-summary', { body: { userId } })

5. Return response and metadata

Include all error handling and logging.
