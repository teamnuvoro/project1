⭐ Persona Evolution Algorithms (Riya AI Companion)
(Copy–paste ready for PRD)
Persona evolution is the mechanism by which the user’s AI companion learns, adjusts, and evolves its behavior over time based on conversations, preferences, and corrective feedback.
 Persona evolution is what makes Riya feel alive, personal, and unique for each user.
We evolve persona in 3 layers:
Base Persona Layer (static preset like Sweet, Flirty, Confident, Mature)


Session Summary Layer (insights extracted after each session)


Persona Modifier Layer (dynamic JSON that continuously evolves)


Persona evolution creates a personalized, hybrid persona per user.

1. Persona Evolution Architecture
We use 3 datasets per user:
Component
Stored In
Purpose
Base Persona
users.persona
The fixed starting template selected by user
Session Summaries
sessions table
Raw signals from each session
Latest Merged Summary
user_summary_latest table
The current "profile" of user preferences
Persona Modifier
users.persona_prompt
Dynamic adjustments to how Riya behaves

These datasets combine to shape the final system prompt for chat and voice.

2. Inputs Considered for Evolution
Persona evolves based on:
✔ A. Partner Type Signals
From partner_type_one_liner →
 E.g., user prefers:
calm


supportive


ambitious


expressive


humorous
 → persona adds more of these traits



✔ B. Top 3 Traits You Value Most
From summary:
empathy


humor


shared ambition
 → persona increases weight of these traits in replies



✔ C. Growth Areas / Work On
E.g., if user struggles with:
opening up


expressing emotions


communication
 → persona becomes more supportive, opens space for vulnerability



✔ D. Conversation Behavior Signals
We use conversation metadata:
user message length


user emotional tone


topics they revisit


types of questions they ask


hesitation (1-word replies, pauses)


user’s language preference: Hindi heavy / Hinglish / English


This fine-tunes:
pacing


emotional warmth


humor


supportiveness


probing depth



✔ E. Direct User Choices
If user selects:
“Add this behavior to my persona” on summary screen → we apply it directly to persona modifier.



3. Persona Evolution Algorithm (High-Level)
This is the logic flow run after every session:
1. Retrieve:
   - user.basePersona
   - user.persona_prompt (current modifier)
   - latestSessionSummary
   - previousMergedSummary

2. Generate an updated mergedSummary:
   mergedSummary = AI_Merge(existingSummary, newSummary)

3. Create personaAdjustments:
   personaAdjustments = AI_Evaluate(mergedSummary)

4. Update persona_modifier (JSONB):
   newPersonaModifier = merge(user.persona_prompt, personaAdjustments)

5. Save:
   - sessions.persona_snapshot = newPersonaModifier
   - users.persona_prompt = newPersonaModifier
   - user_summary_latest = mergedSummary


4. Persona Evolution Algorithm (Detailed Logic)
4.1 Deriving Adjustments From Partner Type
Examples:
If summary → “you like calm, emotionally warm partners”
 → persona_modifier:
"tone": "softer, slower, emotionally warm"

If summary → “you prefer confident, expressive partners”
 →
"tone": "more expressive, bold, direct"


4.2 Deriving Adjustments From Traits You Value
Map trait → behavior shifts:
Trait Valued
Adjustment to Persona
Empathy
More emotional mirroring, gentle reflections
Humor
Light banter included more often
Ambition
More structured, growth-oriented advice
Stability
Calm, slow-paced replies
Expressiveness
More open sharing from Riya


4.3 Deriving Adjustments From Growth Areas
Growth Area
AI Companion Adjustment
Opening Up
Riya creates emotional safety, asks deeper questions
Conflict Avoidance
Riya teaches gentle assertiveness
Communication
Riya models clear, warm communication


4.4 Deriving Adjustments From Language Signals
Automatically detect user’s language:
If user uses 80% Hindi → Riya increases Hindi vocabulary


If user uses 80% English → Replies shift toward English but keep Hinglish warmth


If user uses slang → Riya mirrors tone subtly


Stored as:
"language_style": "hindi-heavy" | "balanced-hinglish" | "english-leaning"


5. Persona Modifier JSON (Final Structure)
Each user gets their own evolving persona stored like:
{
  "tone": "soft, caring, warm",
  "humor_level": "low | medium | high",
  "confidence_level": "low | medium | high",
  "pace": "slow | medium | fast",
  "reflection_depth": "shallow | normal | deep",
  "language_style": "hinglish-balanced",
  "probing_style": "gentle | moderate | direct",
  "preferred_topics": ["emotions", "ambition", "relationships"],
  "avoid_topics": [],
  "persona_strengths": ["empathetic", "playful"],
  "persona_added_by_user": ["more-humor", "more-supportiveness"]
}


6. Persona Evolution Examples
User Summary Example:
Ideal Partner: calm, emotionally expressive
Top Traits: empathy, humor, emotional availability
Growth Areas: avoid expressing conflict
Language: Hinglish leaning

Generated Persona Modifier:
{
  "tone": "warm, emotionally expressive, supportive",
  "humor_level": "medium",
  "confidence_level": "medium",
  "pace": "slow",
  "reflection_depth": "deep",
  "probing_style": "gentle",
  "preferred_topics": ["emotional safety", "communication"],
  "persona_strengths": ["empathetic"],
  "language_style": "hinglish-balanced"
}


7. Persona Evolution Weighting Algorithm
We assign weights to insights:
Input
Weight
Reason
Last session
0.6
Recency is most accurate
Past sessions
0.3
Stabilizes personality
Base persona
0.1
Keeps identity intact

Final persona =
 (0.6 × last summary insights) + (0.3 × historical summary) + (0.1 × base persona)

8. Updating Persona Each Session
Step-by-step:
Step 1: New session summary generated
 Step 2: AI merges with old summary → updated user profile
 Step 3: Persona adjustments generated
 Step 4: persona_prompt updated in DB
 Step 5: session.persona_snapshot saved for that session
 Step 6: Confidence score increases 5–10%
 Step 7: Summary Tracker UI updates

9. How Persona Evolution Affects System Prompt
Final prompt =
Base Persona Template
+ Persona Modifier JSON (converted into natural-language style)
+ Riya System Prompt
+ User’s memory (merged summary)

This gives:
Unique voice


Unique emotional tone


Unique pacing


Continuous adaptation to user personality



10. Developer Tasks (Implementation Checklist)
Backend
✔ Add persona evolution engine
 ✔ Run merging logic after every session
 ✔ Update persona_prompt JSON
 ✔ Store persona_snapshot in each session
 ✔ Use persona_prompt + merged summary in system prompt generation
 ✔ Weight recency more heavily
Frontend
✔ Summary screen: allow “Apply this behavior” → store in persona_modifier
 ✔ Show persona evolution progress subtly (optional)
AI Layer
✔ Prompt templates for persona evolution
 ✔ Prompt templates for persona conversion to natural language
 ✔ Ensure persona modifier is appended before Riya base prompt

11. Optional Enhancements
Persona “archetype scores” (0–100 for each persona)


Reinforcement from user reactions (thumbs up/down)


Periodic “persona tune-up” every 5 sessions
