3. User Journey
3.1 Onboarding
The user begins on a full-screen gradient onboarding flow.
They enter their name, phone number, and gender, followed by OTP verification.
Once verified, the user is redirected to Persona Selection.

3.2 Persona Selection
The user chooses from four broad AI girlfriend personas.
The selected persona becomes the baseline for tone, Hinglish style, pacing, advice style, question style, summary analysis tone, and compatibility interpretation.
a. Sweet & Supportive – “The Caring Listener”
Soft, gentle, empathetic, non-judgmental. Ideal for emotional support and loneliness relief.
b. Playful & Flirty – “The Light-Hearted Best Friend”
Fun, teasing, energetic, humorous. Ideal for lively companionship.
c. Bold & Confident – “The Independent Girl”
Strong, straightforward, expressive, motivating. Ideal for users seeking clarity and growth.
d. Calm & Mature – “The Understanding Soul”
Slow, thoughtful, grounding, emotionally stable. Ideal for users who overthink or feel overwhelmed.
The persona choice is stored and used to shape all AI behavior.
3.3 Chat Experience
After selecting a persona, the user lands on the main chat screen.
The chat interface includes a header, message container, input bar, and a floating call button.
Messages are shown in streaming form, with a typing indicator displayed during LLM processing.
Auto-Greeting (Persona Specific):
Sweet & Supportive (Riya): “Hi… main Riya hoon. Tumse milkar accha laga. Tumhara naam kya hai?”
Playful & Flirty (Meera): “Hiii! Main Meera. Pehle toh batao… tumhara naam kya hai, mister?”
Bold & Confident (Aisha): “Hey, main Aisha hoon. Let’s start simple — tumhara naam kya hai?”
Calm & Mature (Kavya): “Namaste… main Kavya. Tumhara naam jaanna chahti hoon, bataoge?”
Persona-specific quick replies may be shown below the first message. They disappear automatically as the conversation progresses.
3.4 Voice Call Experience
The user may start a call using the floating button.
Before entering the call interface, the system checks free usage limits.
Inside the call, a live real-time loop is maintained: voice to text to LLM to voice.
Each call session uses persona-level call prompts, voice etiquette rules, guardrails, and real-time inference.
At the call end, the transcript and summary are saved.
3.5 Summary Page (High-Level)
After every chat or call session ends, the user is shown a Summary Analysis page.
The page highlights partner type insights, top traits the user values, growth areas, next-session focus, communication style, love language guess, and confidence interval.
Confidence interval begins at 30–40 percent in the first session and increases 5–10 percent after each session.
The user can choose to “add” suggested behaviors to their companion persona, which updates the persona for the next interaction.
3.6 Returning User Flow
Returning users sign in via OTP. They are taken directly to chat. The AI now uses:
The selected base persona
The dynamically evolving persona modifier
Summaries from past sessions
Learned language preferences
User-selected behavioral adjustments
This produces a continuously personalized experience.

5. Voice Call System (Overview)

User starts call → paywall check → call interface.
WebSockets connect for STT and TTS.
The LLM receives persona-modifier + call etiquette + dynamic context.
AI speaks first or waits based on persona.
Real-time voice loop continues until call ends.
Transcript and summary are saved in the session record.
Call session is independent from chat sessions.
Summary page reflects the most recent session only.

6. Summary Tracker (High-Level Overview)
Displays insights based on the last session.
Includes partner type, top traits valued, growth areas, topics for next time, love language guess, communication style, and confidence score.
Confidence score increases steadily across sessions.
User can explicitly add recommended traits or behaviors to the persona for future conversations.
This creates an iterative personalization loop.

7. Prompt Architecture
The prompt stack for each LLM message is layered as follows:
Persona Modifier Block (dynamic per user)
Base Persona Template (based on Riya/Meera/Aisha/Kavya)
Core Riya Behavior Rules
Conversation Memory (selected message history)
Session Metadata (language signals, pacing, emotional cues)


Persona modifier evolves with every session and is saved in the database. Chat and voice calls use the same persona system but with different etiquette and pacing instructions.

Name, phone number, and gender fields.
OTP authentication flow.
Error handling:
	Duplicate number error.

9. Call Pipeline Logic (High-Level Summary)
