Subject: URGENT - 422 Error Persisting Despite Following Specification Exactly

Hi Sarvam Team,

We're still getting a 422 validation error even though we're sending messages in the exact format you specified. We need urgent help to resolve this.

THE ERROR (Still Happening):
```
{
  "type": "error",
  "data": {
    "request_id": "20260109_3ba30e6a-d369-4737-bb12-e7444074d5e0",
    "message": "Input parameters has to be a valid dictionary",
    "code": 422
  }
}
```

WHAT WE'RE SENDING (Exactly as you specified):

Config Message:
```json
{
  "type": "config",
  "data": {
    "target_language_code": "hi-IN",
    "speaker": "meera",
    "pitch": 0,
    "pace": 1,
    "loudness": 1.5,
    "speech_sample_rate": 24000,
    "enable_preprocessing": true
  }
}
```

We've also tried:
- Parameters at root level (without "data" wrapper)
- Minimal config (just target_language_code and speaker)
- All produce the same 422 error

CONNECTION DETAILS:
- WebSocket URL: wss://api.sarvam.ai/text-to-speech/ws?model=bulbul%3Av2&send_completion_event=true
- Authentication: Api-Subscription-Key header (working - we get structured error responses)
- Connection: Establishes successfully ✅
- Error: Occurs immediately when sending config message ❌

CODE VERIFICATION:
- ✅ JSON.stringify() called exactly once
- ✅ Valid JSON structure (verified)
- ✅ WebSocket.send() sends as text frame
- ✅ No double encoding

QUESTIONS:
1. Is there a specific encoding required for the WebSocket message?
2. Do we need to send the message as binary instead of text?
3. Are there any additional headers or query parameters required?
4. Can you provide a working example payload that we can test?
5. Is there a different WebSocket endpoint for bulbul:v2?

We've followed your specification exactly but the server validation keeps rejecting it. Can you verify the exact format on your end and confirm if there's something we're missing?

- 20260109_df785fb4-9ea7-47db-9cc3-20ead3520cdc

ADDITIONAL VERIFICATION:
- ✅ JSON.stringify() produces valid JSON
- ✅ JSON.parse() successfully parses it back (verified in logs)
- ✅ Message sent as text frame (not binary)
- ✅ Message bytes verified: Starts with valid UTF-8 JSON structure

This is blocking our integration. Please help ASAP.

Thanks!
